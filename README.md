# Lecture notes

This repository contains the lecture notes I took from some courses of my Master. These courses include:

* [Algebraic Geometry](https://github.com/alejandroplazagallan/lecture-notes/releases/download/release/Algebraic-Geometry.pdf): these notes comprehend in fact two courses:

  * Algebraic Geometry I corresponds to Chapters 1-11,
  
  * Algebraic Geometry II corresponds to Chapters 12-24;

* [Partial Differential Equations](https://github.com/alejandroplazagallan/lecture-notes/releases/download/release/PDEs.pdf).
